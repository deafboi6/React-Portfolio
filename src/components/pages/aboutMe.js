            <h4>
                Hello! My name is Jayden Chapman and I am 23 years old, born at the tail end of 1999. I grew up in Washington state,
                home to the beautiful Pacific North West. I am currently engaged to my beautiful fianc√©e Bailey, with plans to get
                married in October. She is my high school sweetheart, and we have lived together since graduating high school, raising
                a few beautiful pets in the process. My father was a programmer with Microsoft for most of my childhood, which spurred 
                my interest and love for computers and all things tech related.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                After graduating from high school in 2017, I immediately went to college for a short duration, before the cost of the
                classes pushed me out. Following this, I went on to work for Boeing for a short duration before joining Xfinity as a
                field technician. I've worked for Xfinity since 2019, and have enjoyed my time here. My motivation to get back into 
                learning spurred me to start the University of Washington's Full-Stack Development program, and I will be graduating 
                March 27th! 
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Since joining this program, I have learned a tremendous amount about all things coding related, and have since built
                fully functional web applications, front-to-back, back-to-front. My primary coding language is Javascript, with strong
                applications in Node.js, React, MERN, SQL, NoSQL, and so on. I am highly motivated and excited to learn more, as well
                as apply my skills to optimal use.
